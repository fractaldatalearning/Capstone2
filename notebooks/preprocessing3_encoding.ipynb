    "This is my final preprocessing notebook before modeling. Here, I'll start with trying out models' performances given various variable encoding strategies. I need to explore the possibility of feature reduction; I created multiple features in the previous notebook but am not yet sure if they'll be valuable in making predictions. I can begin to explore various models in the process of all this. \n",
